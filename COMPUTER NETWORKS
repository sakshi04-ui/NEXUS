 I wanted to share my progress from mid-August when I completed the first module of the Nexus course! During that week, I covered 10 lectures focused on Computer Networks (CN)—and what a deep dive it was! 🌐

From exploring fundamental concepts like network topologies, TCP/IP, and OSI models to understanding the intricacies of VPNs, IP addressing, and even the dark web, this course has given me a whole new perspective on how the Internet operates securely and efficiently.

💡 These insights have not only expanded my technical knowledge but also enhanced my problem-solving approach in tech. Grasping the importance of different IP classes, routing, and addressing schemes and seeing how they all interconnect has been truly eye-opening.

I’m excited to share my journey, and here’s a snapshot of my handwritten notes to give you a peek into my study process! 📝
